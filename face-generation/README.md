# Face Generation
This repo contains my submission for the GAN Project (Generate Faces) in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. Implemented with PyTorch.

## Overview
Use Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) to generate realistic, fake faces that resemble faces found in the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)
