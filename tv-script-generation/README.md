# TV Script Generation
This repo contains my submission for the RNN Project (Generate TV Scripts) in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. Implemented with PyTorch.

## Overview
Given a dataset consisting of scripts from 9 seasons of the TV show Seinfeld, this algorithm uses word embeddings and LSTMs to learn from the data and generate new, "fake" TV scripts.

## Example Output: Fake TV Script
